If the YouTube algorithm worked correctly only once, that's when it suggested me a video from *Core Dumped* channel when I was searching about weak, soft and strong references in Java.  
Apparently this is a new channel with only 5 videos at the time of writing this blog, explaining memory management concepts with a little bit of focus on Rust.
Despite having prior studies about memory management, watching these videos offering proper visualization and clear explanation taught me one or two points.

This is the link to YouTube channel:

And if like me you follow YT using an RSS client here is the RSS URL:
