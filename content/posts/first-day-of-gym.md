If there is only one thing I regret for when thinking about past 5 months, it's living a potato style life.
As someone who spend hours sitting behind a keyboard at work, then spend 10 more hours working with computer at his spare time, what I mostly need is some physical activity.  
But due to a very busy schedule and of course *laziness* I had no exercise, till today.
I made up my mind and went back to the CrossFit gym I used to train at.

Everything was cool and I felt good about pushing myself into the gym again.
Seeing some people I knew and their warm greetings actually made my day, I was happy that coach remembered me and stuff like these...  

The dark side starts when despite my coach warning me not to put too much pressure on myself, I didn't listen to him.
With this wrong mindset of still being the same person from few months ago, picked up weights that I was using back then, ran 5 kilometers like others, and pushed myself accepting no excuses.  
But that was totally a mistake.
30~40 minutes after starting the exercise I reached to end of my physical and mental self, it felt like I used all calories in my body and even didn't have enough energy to breath.
So I went to a corner and sat peacefully for 2 or 3 minutes to regain strength, but my situation only got worse to the point I was passing out.
And in a moment ignoring vertigo ran to the bathroom as fast as I could and had no choice but vomiting.

I couldn't imagine something like this might happen otherwise wouldn't push myself this hard.  
Though a friend was kind enough to drive me and my bicycle home.
But that was a pretty fucked up experience I had to bear.
