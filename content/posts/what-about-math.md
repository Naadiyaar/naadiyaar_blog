I was never good at math. It's a fact in my life and I can't remember a single time I got the highest score in a math quiz or exam in class.
It doesn't mean I was bad at math though, in fact unlike other lessons I used to study math regularly and helped me to have an insight of what math was about; Even if you don't commit your life on something, after doing it for 12 years you'll eventually get idea of what's it about.
But of course one doesn't have to do something only because schools says so, in simple words, even though I wasn't that good at math solving math problems was a fun activity in my eyes and any class related to math was always extremely exciting to me either if it was Geometry, Algebra or Trigonometry I was always so amazed by listening to math lessons and seeing how small separated pieces sicked together formed a bigger piece, full of harmony and amazing relationships.

But how possibly sitting still and staring and ambiguous, non-standard and self-made symbols for hours can be fun?


**NOTE** see math as puzzle instead of reason
