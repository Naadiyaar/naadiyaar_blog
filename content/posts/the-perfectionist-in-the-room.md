You might be a perfectionist. But be careful despite the glorious look of this attribute
you probably want to seek for treatments rather honoring it. So now we have a few questions
to begin with, *am I perfectionist?*, *how is this affecting my life?* and 
*how to stop being one?* so I'm going to answer these question in rest of this blog.

Also keep in mind, having high standards and seeking for greatness is different than
obsession for perfection.

## Who's called perfectionist?
Perfectionism like other personality traits includes a wide spectrum of behaviors.
Including but not limited to being highly critical, having unrealistic standards and
fear of failure. I know this list seems like content of the book
"Three Traits Of successful People" but many studies have shown that unfortunately,
perfectionist are performing worse, and of course not as good as themselves expect.
So how do we know if we're perfectionist? As said it's part of human's nature
and an aspect of our personality. Which means all of us experience some sort of these
and other symptoms but it doesn't mean we're all perfectionist. You realize you're a
perfectionist when you limp at parts of your life. When you start seeing a problem.
When you feel being crushed by works. When you do a lot, but still haven't done anything.
At this time, solution is lies inside.

If you want to understand where are you standing, you need to start questioning
yourself. I can help with three questions, if your answer to any of is yes, there's a
high chance that you're a perfectionist.

### 1. Do you procrastinate A LOT?
Procrastinating for hours, days or even months is highly common among people who are
frantically looking for the right time to start.

### 2. Do you think you're not enough?
Well, no one is perfect. I don't have to test every human on the planet to get to this 
conclusion. It's natural, and poor perfectionist assume it's not.

### 3. Are you afraid of failure?
Yes, everybody does. But do you afraid so much that you even afraid tying to get better?

If your answer to **any** of the questions above is yes, then probably you're also with
us in this train. Sit tight, and continue reading.

## How does it affect your life?
Perfectionism is a perspective, it's a stand point where you see everything from, therefor
it affects everything you do (or never start doing), and most importantly it brings **pain**
and that's what hurts. Perfectionism makes everything painful. It's the first time your
friends invited you to play golf with them, everyone knew it was your first time and
no one had any expectations of you, no one but yourself. You were forced to be good.
So obsessed to perform well that you forgot to enjoy the experience of playing golf
with your friends for the first time.

Life of a perfectionist is full of struggles and fights for getting *perfect* that
she forgets to breathe, and enjoy her activity. To for once, do it for herself.
And this is where getting better comes from, you can't find a guitarist who
trained thousands of hours and enjoyed it, but still is a bad guitarist.
However there is another side to this, a perfectionist will spend all of her day
trying to become *great* at *everything* but finds herself doing no so *great*.

But it is curable, we're not born perfectionists. Imagine if a baby was stuck with
perfectionism, he could say if I'll never will be able to fly, why should I even
try crawling? But hey! Humans eventually learn to walk in early ages.

## Then How to get free?
Perfectionism can be both *cause* and *effect*.  
It can be a symptom itself, a siren that informs of a more serious issue. ADHD is
one of mental disorder that can trigger perfectionism on given person.  
Or it can only be the result of a wrong mindset. A mindset that tells you you're
so great, that you don't deserve to be bad at something. But that's not true!
(you're great) but you have the right to be wrong, to lack at something and to
perform bad.  

You want a solution? It's fairly simple, tell your brain to shut up.
Tell your brain that you have the right to do or publish something only because
you like to. Let your mind believe if you're sharing your art online it's not
because you are trying to show world how good you are (this can be) but you're
doing it, because you're enjoying it!  

If you don't know where to start, You can pay more attention to your daily activities. 
Before starting, or right them down at the end of the day and think about them.
How could you do that activity if you had no perfectionism? What went wrong?  
And next time that you were in the same position. Just remember, it doesn't have to
be perfect, it just needs to be fun for you.
