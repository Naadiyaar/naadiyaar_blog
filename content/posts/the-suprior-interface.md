## Intro
Using command line based applications is a choice, and not a normal one but the best choice (anytime possible).
That means I use CLI (and TUI) programs as much as possible and in this article I also explain why you should do the same.
What is a CLI app why are they better than GUI apps and why they're real gems among fake jewels.
And finally show you some of my favorite CLI programs.

## Predictable
When you work with a command line app their is no confusion. No hidden extra steps happens in the background.
You **command** programs and they do exactly what you asked for.

`start` means start

`stop` means stop

`save-and-stop` means save content before stopping

And if you want to simply modify the default behavior of a command flags are on your fingertip.
