Content in this post are mostly personal opinions and preferences, and are not based on facts or deep researches.
But they are fine choices and still generate posts in this blog.
So I don't use AI to form this place.
It doesn't mean I'm not using any writing helper to create better posts but none of them come close to whatever an AI capable of to.
Indeed, if you read texts carefully enough you'll notice enormous mistakes and phrases with critical need for a review :)

Which well... a language model could detect and fix many of them easily, it can suggest more beautiful words or even rewrite a whole paragraph in a 2 times pleasant way.
Specially for me, who uses English as a second (third?) language and coming from a right-to-left language background with a totally different grammar structure.
By these things being said, any sane mine would think a proper tool chain of LMs is exactly the first thing I need to start a blog.
Using a capable AI model correctly will clearly improve my posts quality and attracts more audiences.
I'd love that!
I'd love to write best posts possible, but still no thanks, *this blog is man-made!*

## So why?
Because it's how it must be! 
A personal weblog must feel like and represent one.
A good weblog reflects the soul of writer into posts and doesn't matter how broken the heart, words must mint with warmth of a heart.

Let's be honest, we don't read a blog because it's the most well created text on internet, otherwise we would have read from Shakespeare, or before following any blog we were checking whether the author has PhD in linguistics related fields or not.
But rather we read a blog to understand the person behind those texts and know how they think about a specific subject.
