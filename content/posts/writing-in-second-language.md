This blog is not the only place where I write English, in fact in Mastodon I post in English and most of the time I participate in group chats talking in English.
And it might seem unreasonable for someone whose mother tongue isn't English.

It seems so difficult to **write** in second language.

**Read** in second language.

**Think** in second language.

And **understand** a second language.

Because it is; it's hard and unproductive. For me, it takes much more time to develop an idea in English compared to my mother tongue, Kurdish. Especially when what I'm writing about is a complex subject by itself, it doubles up difficulties. And it's a very challenging activity to explain concepts in the limited number of words I know and it drains my energy so fast. (takes a long break here)

I believe the first question comes to mind is *what is this mental illness called* but I assure you I'm not mentally sick(I hope). 
So the second question might be *why am I doing this?* because there must be a well thought reason for it; well yes, but no, I mean kind of.
The truth is I hope to find out the answer of the second question myself by end of the article :)

## So why?
First of all **to learn**; what's a better way to get better in a new language than pushing yourself to write in it? And also who doesn't like being fluent in a second language?

Second reason is publishing in English simply **connects** me to **most of the world** and more audiences can use a post. But I'm not a content creator, I don't gather cookies and couldn't care less about the number of people following me online.

Till now none of them are so convenient are they? Well the second part is simply 99% of the argument.

It's **easier to write in a second language**.
