This is my summerization from the famous book [Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Engineering-Practitioners-Roger-Pressman-dp-1259872971/dp/1259872971)
from Roger S. Pressman and Bruce R. Maxim.  
This is a fairly huge book and reading through all of it can be time consuming, therefore I decided
to type down my take from the book and publish it for those who don't want to read the whole book
but still are interested in what's inside of it.
