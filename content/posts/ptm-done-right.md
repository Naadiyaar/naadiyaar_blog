I always believed one tool can't work best for everyone and people should choose their instruments themselves.
There is not a single tool suitable for everything and or everyone, and it's always part of the work to find the right tool.  
And for the first time ever, finally I know how to get things done and see my tasks list is actually shrinking.
Here I'm going to write about my approach which might work, or at least inspire you too.

In this blog you will read about a command line task management program called [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) and a little bit about how I use it by help of [GTD](https://gettingthingsdone.com/) method.  
I've started using these two almost 2 months ago and seen very good results so far.
But never liked to spend so much time digging deep into TW or GTD, so everything might not be best practices but this is how I do things and will love to hear your opinion either.

## On Taskwarrior
Taskwarrior lets you create, organize, manage and get visual reports for your tasks and ToDos all within terminal.  
If you're wondering [why you want to use a task management app in terminal]({{< ref "/content/posts/the-suprior-interface.md" >}}), I already wrote blog talking about that.
But if that's not the case (hopefully) please continue reading.
