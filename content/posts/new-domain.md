It's been a long time I haven't written anything on this blog. 
Because of some psychological difficulties, I was forced to start medication which decreased my mental ability to function.
I'm no better right now, but thought it's necessary to put myself together and write these few words about changes.

So, this website's TLD is already changed but the old domain is still accessible so you can see this post. 
But I'm not going to revenue the old domain and it will eventually stop working.  
Basically changes are like this:

The new domain: **nadiyar.com**  
The old domain: naadiyaar.com

As you see both domains are my name the new one has two characters less and therefor I thought it's a good investment to update.  
The point is when I first started this blog the TLD **nadiyar** was captured and I had to continue with the old *naadiyaar*.

**Thanks for reading; please let me know what do you think.  
Good luck.**
