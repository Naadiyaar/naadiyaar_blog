It's been a long time I haven't written anything in this blog. 
Because of some psychological difficulties, I was forced to start medication which decreased my mental ability to function.
I'm no better right now, but thought it's necessary to put myself together and write these few words about changes.

So, this website's TLD is already changed but the old domain is still accesable so you can see this post.  
Basicly canges are like this:
```
new domain: nadiyar.com
old domain: naadiyaar.com
```
